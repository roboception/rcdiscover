<p>
    Devices that are powered up and connected to the local network or
    directly to a computer can be found using the standard GigE Vision®
    discovery mechanism. At startup, all available devices
    are listed with their name, serial number, current IP, and unique MAC
    address. The discovery tool finds all devices reachable by global
    broadcasts. Misconfigured devices that are located in different subnets
    than the computer may also be listed. An icon in the discovery tool
    indicates whether devices are actually reachable via a web browser.
    A rescan can be initiated by clicking on <em>Rerun Discovery</em>
</p>

<p>
    After successful discovery, a double click on the device row opens
    the Web GUI of the device in the default web browser of the
    operating system.
</p>

<H2><a name="reset" id="reset">Resetting configuration</a></H2>

<p>
    Only <em>rc_visard</em> devices have custom feature to reset them if misconfigured.
</p>

<p>
    A misconfigured <em>rc_visard</em> can be reset by using the <em>Reset rc_visard</em>
    button in the discovery tool. The reset mechanism is only available for
    two minutes after device startup. Thus, a reboot of the <em>rc_visard</em>
    may be required before being able to reset the device.
</p>

<p>
    If the misconfigured <em>rc_visard</em> is still successfully detected
    by the discovery tool, it can be selected from the <em>rc_visard</em>
    drop down menu. Otherwise, the <em>rc_visard</em>'s MAC address, which
    is printed on the device label, can be entered manually in the designated
    fields.
</p>

<p>After entering the MAC address one of four options can be chosen:</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>Reset Parameters</em>: Reset all <em>rc_visard</em>
            parameters that are configurable via the Web GUI (e.g.,
            frame rate).
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Reset Network</em>: Reset network settings and user
            defined name.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Reset All</em>: Reset <em>rc_visard</em> parameters as well
            as network settings and user defined name.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Switch Partitions</em>: Allows to perform a rollback to the
            previous firmware.
        </li>
    <ul>
</p>

<p>
    A successful reset is indicated by a white status LED followed by a
    device reboot. If no reaction is noticeable, the two minutes time slot
    may have passed, requiring another reboot.
</p>

<H2><a name="forceip" id="forceip">Assigning a temporary IP address</a></H2>

<p>
    In case a device is not reachable from the computer, it can
    be assigned a temporary IP address by clicking the <em>Set temporary
    IP address</em> button. In the popup, the device can then
    either be selected from the drop down menu or one can enter its MAC address,
    which is printed on the device label, manually.
</p>

<p>
    After filling the MAC address, the fields for <em>IP address</em>,
    <em>subnet mask</em> and <em>standard gateway</em> need to be completed.
    The subnet mask and the standard gateway are automatically set to default
    values that can be changed. By clicking <em>Set temporary IP address</em>,
    these values are applied.
</p>

<p>
    If this operation was successful, after clicking
    <em>Rerun discovery</em>, the device will be listed
    with its new IP address.
</p>

<p>
    Setting a temporary IP is useful for making a device with misconfigured
    network settings reachable for web browsers and standard GigE Vision
    clients. The settings are only valid until the network is reconnected
    or the device is restarted. Please use a standard GigE Vision 2.0 client,
    such as gc_config that is provided in the rc_genicam_api package, to
    reconfigure the network permanently.
</p>

<H2><a name="reconnect" id="">Reconnecting a device</a></H2>

<p>
    With the <em>reconnect</em> functionality of rcdiscover, a reinitialization
    of a device's network interface can be triggered. This is
    comparable with an unplugging and replugging of the network cable.
    Reconnecting a device is especially useful in two scenarios:
</p>

<p>
    First, if a temporary IP address has been assigned to a device
    by above procedure, reconnecting causes the assignment to be undone;
    hence, the IP address is reset to the device's
    previous IP address.
</p>

<p>
    Second, after changing the persistent network settings using
    a standard GigE Vision 2.0 client, such as gc_config in the rc_genicam_api
    package, a reconnect applies the new settings.
    This avoids the need for restarting the device or
    manually replugging its network cable.
